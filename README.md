# Walking Tracker

This is a small application that tracks how many steps I take based on a pre-determined steps/second based on the speed of my treadmill. I can change the speed and that will change the steps/second.

## Features

- Track how many steps I am taking daily/total
- Ability to start/end a segment to track how many steps during that segment
- See total stats: Walking Time, Total Steps, Total Miles
- Save/Load to Firebase Database
